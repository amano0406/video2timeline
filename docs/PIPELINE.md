# Pipeline

## 1. Configure

`settings save` defines input video roots and `outputRoot`.

## 2. Discover

`files list` scans configured input roots for supported video extensions.

Supported extensions:

```text
.avi .m4v .mkv .mov .mp4 .webm .wmv
```

## 3. Probe

`probe list` runs ffprobe read-only and derives source identity, source
fingerprint, and item id from path/stat metadata.

## 4. Inspect Components

`models list` reports local processing components, pyannote/ZIPA dependency
readiness, and token status. It does not process source videos.

## 5. Sample

`sample frames` extracts a bounded set of review frames and a contact sheet.
It does not extract all frames.

## 6. Frame OCR

`ocr frames` runs local Tesseract OCR over generated frame sample artifacts. This
follows the TimelineForImage OCR contract, but the implementation is local to
TimelineForVideo.

The same pass records bounded visual features for each generated frame:
brightness, contrast, dominant colors, and a 3x3 average-color grid.

## 7. Audio Analysis

`audio analyze` extracts a generated MP3 derivative under `outputRoot` for
review, creates a temporary normalized WAV for model processing, runs ffmpeg
speech candidate detection on that WAV, and runs TimelineForAudio-compatible
pyannote diarization and ZIPA phone-like acoustic-unit extraction over the same
WAV. The model calls are scoped to detected speech candidates where possible, so
silent spans are not sent through the heavy audio model path. The temporary WAV
is removed after processing. The source video is not modified or copied.

## 8. Refresh Items

`activity map` combines the audio speech candidates with five-minute visual
sentinel deltas. It writes `raw_outputs/activity_map.json` with active
candidate intervals and inactive intervals that can be skipped because the
audio is silent and the visual signal is static.

`items refresh` is the normal product processing entrypoint. It discovers
configured source videos, checks the internal catalog, and processes changed or
incomplete items only.

For selected candidates it runs:

1. bounded frame sampling
2. frame OCR over generated frame artifacts
3. generated audio evidence and TimelineForAudio-compatible audio models
4. activity mapping
5. item record assembly

It writes:

- `video_record.json`
- `timeline.json`
- `convert_info.json`
- `raw_outputs/ffprobe.json`
- `raw_outputs/activity_map.json`

The internal catalog, lock, worker status, and run status are stored under the
Docker app-data volume. They are not source inputs and are not exported.

## 9. Full Processing

`process all` forces the same pipeline over the selected batch. It is primarily
for manual validation and reprocessing.

## 10. Export Or Remove

`items download` creates a generated-artifact ZIP and updates `latest`.
`items remove` deletes only known generated artifacts.
