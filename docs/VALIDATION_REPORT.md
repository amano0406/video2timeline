# Validation Report

Generated after current resident-worker, audio/image parity, export, and source
safety validation.

  audio-model dependency/token status.

  prerequisites.

## Smoke Coverage

The final smoke test generated a short local sample video with audio under
`C:\Codex\tmp`, then verified:

- `doctor`
- `models list`
- `serve --once --max-items 1 --samples-per-video 3`
- `audio analyze --audio-model-mode required`
- `items list`
- `items download`
- `items remove --dry-run`
- `items remove`

The smoke test confirmed:

- `raw_outputs/frame_ocr.json` was written.
- frame OCR subpayloads used Image-compatible snake_case fields such as
  `has_text`, `full_text`, `block_id`, and `bbox_norm`.
- `raw_outputs/audio_analysis.json` was written.
- `artifacts/audio/source_audio.mp3` was written under `outputRoot`.
- `convert_info.json` included both `ffprobeVersion` and `ffmpegVersion`.
- `items list` reported OCR and audio-evidence counts.
- `audioModelMode: auto` recorded `not_configured` without inventing speaker
  turns or phone tokens when no Hugging Face token was configured.
- `audioModelMode: required` returned a structured failure when no Hugging Face
  token was configured.
- `audioModelMode: required` also fails structurally when the video has no audio
  stream.
- the ZIP contained generated item files and did not contain `.mp4` source video
  files or `.mp3` audio derivatives.
- after `items remove`, the source video still existed and its size/mtime were
  unchanged.

Temporary smoke-test files were removed after validation.
